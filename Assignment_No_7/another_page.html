        beings, birds, animals, etc. In nature, everyone depends on one another to keep the ecosystem healthy. For
        survival, every creature is interrelated and reliant on one another. Humans, for example, rely on nature for
        their survival, and nature provides us with oxygen, food, water, shelter, medicines, and clothing, among other
        things. Many shades may be seen in nature, contributing to the planetâ€™s beauty. Along with humans, animals and
        birds also find their habitat and means of survival in nature. Therefore, it is essential to take proper care of
